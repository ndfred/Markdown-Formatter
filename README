Markdown Formatter
==================

This simple Makefile automates the process of converting [Markdown][]-formatted
files to HTML.
The processing also uses [SmartyPants][] to get the dashes right.

To use it, simple create a couple of `.text` files and run `make`.
It will download Markdown and SmartyPants and create the corresponding HTML
files.

You will need `GNU Make` and `perl` to make it work.
RTF generation is also possible on Mac OS X via `textutil`.
